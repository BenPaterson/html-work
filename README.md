# html-work

Ok, create a layout in the index.html file where we can work.  Lets say 960px wide, centered on the screen.  Make two containers (div containers are fine for now), on top of each other, 540px height.  Pop a border and some padding between the containers. You should be able to google around and figure out all of this.  Use CSS styles for the layout/padding/border. 

This is a good place to start for a boilerplate html template:

Note that the boilerplate has references to things we may not use yet (css and js files...look for lines where there is a path like "js/blah.js" or whatever)...just comment them out.  You should be able to type some text in the body, open the file in Chrome, or another browser, and see the text.
